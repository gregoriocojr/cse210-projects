A question about RecordEvent and the GoalManager from a student:
Every class that inherits from Goal needs to implement the RecordEvent, 
IsComplete, and GetStringRepresentation.  They will either use the 
GetDetailsString provided in the Goal class or they will override with 
a new function (to do something different).  

The purpose of RecordEvent is to determine if the goal is complete and 
to return points.  Each type of Goal does it differently:

ChecklistGoal – Update the counter for the number of types the goal has 
been accomplished.  Return points everytime they meet the goal.  Return 
additional bonus points once they have completed the goal multiple times 
(according to the target)
	
SimpleGoal – Give points once the goal is accomplished and then mark it 
completed (can’t do it again).
	
EternalGoal – Give points when the goal is accomplished but never mark 
it completed.

By implementing the RecordEvent in each class, you will be able to call 
RecordEvent on any Goal and it will work.  This is polymorphism.

The GoalManager does not inherit from the Goal class.  Instead of putting 
all the menu logic, the saving/loading from files, and the prompts to the 
user in the Main function, we will put that in the GoalManager class.  
The GoalManager also keeps track of the user points and the list of Goals. 
This means that the Main function just has to create a GoalManager object 
and call Start.

The GoalManager does the following:
Start – Display the menu and responds to the user choice
DisplayPlayerInfo – Display the points
ListGoalNames – Display all the goal names
ListGoalDetails – Display all the details of each goal 
(calls GetDetailsString)
SaveGoals – Save the goals to a file
LoadGoals – Load the goals from a file
CreateGoal – Give a menu to the user to select what kind of goal to 
create, ask the user to type in the goal information (depending on the 
goal type selected), create the goal object, and add it to the goal list
RecordEvent – Show a list of goals to the user and let them select the 
goal that they just completed.  This is where you will call the 
RecordEvent in the goal object (what we talked about above).
